### 2025-12-18 - Multi-User Katas Finalization & UX Refinement

**Objective**: finalize multi-user editing with high stability, performance, and premium UX.

**Changes Made**:

1.  **High-Performance Architecture**
    - **Asynchronous Compilation**: Moved `DynamicCompiler.compile/3` into a `Task.async` to prevent blocking the LiveView process.
    - **Dynamic Module Management**: Implemented module rewriting to allow each user/session to have a unique, non-colliding module in the BEAM.
    - **Optimized Auto-Save**: Reduced CodeMirror debounce to 1s and removed optimistic server-side updates to prevent focus loss.

2.  **Stable UX & Layout**
    - **Header Integration**: Integrated "Saved!" and "Compiling..." indicators directly into the header to avoid tab button overlap.
    - **Non-Disruptive Error Banner**: Moved compilation errors from global flashes (which shift layout) to an absolutely positioned banner at the bottom of the editor.
    - **Revert to Original**: Moved the revert button to the header for better access and layout stability.

3.  **Robustness Fixes**
    - **Graceful Error Recovery**: Updated `KataHostLive.mount` to handle compilation errors by showing an error banner instead of crashing the LiveView.
    - **Casing & Null Safety**: Fixed case-sensitivity in compilation error detection and added guards for nil module rendering.

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/elixir_katas_web/live/kata_host_live.ex`
- `lib/elixir_katas_web/components/kata_components.ex`
- `lib/elixir_katas/katas/dynamic_compiler.ex`
- `architecture.md`
- `history.md`

**Commits**:
- `feat: multi-user kata editing with dynamic compilation`
- `perf: async compilation for smooth editor UX`
- `fix: prevent focus loss and layout shifts during auto-save`
- `refactor: integrate status indicators into kata header`
- `docs: update architecture and history for multi-user editing`


### 2025-12-18 - Bulk Kata Migration & Dynamic Hosting

**Objective**: Convert all 100+ LiveView katas into dynamically hosted `LiveComponent`s to support user-specific editing and execution.

**Changes Made**:

1.  **Dynamic Routing Refinement**
    - Updated `KataHostLive.mount/3` to robustly extract `kata_id` from URL slugs (e.g., `03-mirror`).
    - Standardized all kata URLs to use the `/katas/:slug` pattern.

2.  **Automated Migration Script**
    - Developed and refined `priv/scripts/migrate_katas.exs` to perform bulk transformations.
    - Converted `use :live_view` to `use :live_component`.
    - Renamed `mount/3` to `update/2` and injected automatic socket assignments.
    - Stripped problematic `File.read!` calls and their corresponding `source_code`/`notes_content` assignments that caused runtime compilation errors in the dynamic context.
    - Automated the injection of `phx-target={@myself}` into all interactive elements (buttons, forms, etc.).

3.  **Stability & Verification**
    - Verified that 100% of migrated katas compile successfully.
    - Manually verified representative katas (01, 03, 35, 42) in the browser, confirming that the interactive logic, source code viewer, and tab switching are functional.

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/elixir_katas_web/live/kata_host_live.ex`
- `priv/scripts/migrate_katas.exs`
- `lib/elixir_katas_web/live/kata_*.ex` (bulk migration)

**Commits**:
- `feat: dynamic kata_id resolution from URL slugs`
- `tool: refined bulk migration script with aggressive variable stripping`
- `refactor: migrate all katas to dynamically hosted LiveComponents`
